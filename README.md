# Algorithms and data structures - Lab 1

Write programs to perform 5 different types of tasks:
1) elementary operators
2) conditional operators
3) cycles
4) arrays
5) functions

Check the correct operation of programs with different input data. 

In tasks where any variables are entered, it is desirable to implement their setting via data entry from the terminal (eg cin). In tasks with arrays it is recommended to fill them with random numbers (rand () function).

<b>Importantly!</b> Allowed libraries to connect:
- I / O libraries: \<iostream>, \<iomanip>, <stdio.h>, <conio.h>
- library of mathematical functions: \<cmath> (math.h)
- libraries for the randomize function: \<cstdlib> (stdlib.h), \<ctime> (time.h)
- library to support Cyrillic output: \<clocale> (locale.h)
- library for support of Ukrainian letters in the Windows console: <windows.h>

1. Find the distance between the points 洧냢 (洧논1, 洧녽1) and 洧냣 (洧논2, 洧녽2) on the plane.
2. The coordinates of point x and y are given. Check that it lies on the coordinate axis Ox or Oy and display a message about it.
3. Organize an endless loop until the user enters 0 from the keyboard, then display how many attempts it took.
4. Given an array of real numbers of size 16 elements which will be: 洧녩0, ..., 洧녩15. Find 洧녴洧녩洧논(洧녩0 - 洧녩8, 洧녩1 - 洧녩9, ..., 洧녩7 - 洧녩15).
5. Set the mathematical function 洧녭(洧논) = 洧논<sup>3</sup> - 2洧논<sup>2</sup> + 洧논 - 1 as a function. Find the maximum value of the function on the segment [-3, 4], search to perform withstep 0.5.
